## 🚀 Quick Start

### Step 1: Setup (5 minutes)

```bash
cd /Users/dennis/dev/jamf-snipe-sync

# Create .env file with your credentials
cat > .env << 'EOF'
JAMF_URL=https://your-jamf-instance.jamfcloud.com
JAMF_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
JAMF_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
SNIPE_IT_URL=https://your-snipe-it-instance.com
SNIPE_IT_API_TOKEN=your_api_token
EOF

# Install dependencies
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 2: Test Connection (Optional but Recommended)

```bash
python3 test-connection.py
```

Expected output:
```
✅ All systems operational - Ready for sync!
```

### Step 3: Run the Sync

```bash
./run-ultimate-sync.sh
```

**That's it!** The script will handle everything automatically.

## 🎯 Key Features

### 1. 100% Device Coverage
- Fetches ALL computers from Jamf (with pagination)
- Fetches ALL mobile devices from Jamf (with pagination)
- No devices skipped or missed
- Processes prestage-only devices

### 2. Intelligent Rate Limiting
```python
RATE_LIMIT_DELAY = 1.5 seconds   # Between API calls
BATCH_SIZE = 100 devices         # Process in batches
BATCH_DELAY = 10 seconds         # Between batches
MAX_RETRIES = 5                  # Retry attempts
```

### 3. Prestage-Based Categorization
- Uses Jamf prestage enrollment for accurate categorization
- Smart fallbacks based on device model, email, and naming
- Category-specific models to prevent Snipe-IT overrides

### 4. User Mapping
- Automatically looks up users by email
- Checks out devices to users

---

## 🔍 Verification

After sync, verify 100% accuracy:

```bash
python3 verify-100-percent-sync.py
```

This will:
1. Count all devices in Jamf Pro
2. Count all assets in Snipe-IT
3. Identify any missing devices
4. Calculate sync accuracy percentage
5. Report on user assignments

Expected output:
```
Sync Accuracy: 100.00%

jamf_snipe_ultimate_sync_20251007_143000.log
  - Complete sync operation log
  - Device-by-device processing
  - Category assignment reasoning
  - User mapping results
  - Error details and retries

verification_20251007_150000.log
  - Verification results
  - Missing device lists
  - Sync statistics
```

## 🔧 Customization

### Adjust Rate Limiting

Edit `jamf-snipe-ultimate-100-percent-sync.py`:

```python
# For slower, more conservative sync (if getting rate limited)
RATE_LIMIT_DELAY = 2.0   # Increase delay
BATCH_SIZE = 50          # Smaller batches

# For faster sync (use with caution)
RATE_LIMIT_DELAY = 1.0   # Decrease delay
BATCH_SIZE = 200         # Larger batches
```

### Adjust Category Mappings

Edit the `CATEGORIES` dictionary to match your Snipe-IT setup:

```python
CATEGORIES = {
    'student': {'id': 12, 'name': 'Student Loaner Laptop'},
    'staff': {'id': 16, 'name': 'Staff Mac Laptop'},
    # ... add or modify as needed
}
```

---

## 🔄 Automation

### Daily Scheduled Sync

```bash
# Add to crontab
crontab -e

# Run at 2 AM daily
0 2 * * * cd /Users/dennis/dev/jamf-snipe-sync && /usr/bin/python3 jamf-snipe-ultimate-100-percent-sync.py >> /var/log/jamf-sync.log 2>&1
```

### Weekly Verification

```bash
# Verify every Monday at 3 AM
0 3 * * 1 cd /Users/dennis/dev/jamf-snipe-sync && /usr/bin/python3 verify-100-percent-sync.py >> /var/log/jamf-verification.log 2>&1
```

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Quick Diagnostics

```bash
# Test API connections
python3 test-connection.py

# View latest log
tail -100 jamf_snipe_ultimate_sync_*.log | tail

# Check for errors
grep "❌" jamf_snipe_ultimate_sync_*.log

# Check for warnings
grep "⚠️" jamf_snipe_ultimate_sync_*.log
```

### Common Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Rate limiting (429 errors) | Script handles automatically; increase `RATE_LIMIT_DELAY` if persistent |
| Authentication failures | Check `.env` file credentials; run `test-connection.py` |
| Missing devices | Run `verify-100-percent-sync.py` to identify; check logs for specific errors |
| Slow sync | Normal for large device counts; can run in background with `nohup` |
