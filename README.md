# WIC Loaner Device Request System

> **Note:** This app is managed by PM2, which provides process monitoring, automatic restarts, and basic failover. The system is already redundant and tolerates most failures automatically.
The troubleshooting section below is provided just in case manual intervention is needed.

## Overview

This system allows students at West Island College (WIC) to request loaner laptops or chargers. It automates ticket creation in Freshdesk, sends confirmation emails, and provides a modern, branded user experience. The system is built with **Next.js**, **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, and runs on a Linux VM with PM2.

## What To Do If The System Fails or Goes Down

### 1. **Check if the App is Running**
```bash
pm2 list
```
- If the status is not "online", restart:
```bash
pm2 restart loanerform
```

### 2. **Check Logs for Errors**
```bash
pm2 logs loanerform
```
- Look for errors related to port conflicts, build failures, or missing dependencies.

### 3. **Rebuild the App**
If you suspect a build or dependency issue:
```bash
cd /path/to/loanerform
npm install
npm run build
pm2 restart loanerform
```

### 4. **Check Port Conflicts**
If the app won't start, check if port 3000 is already in use:
```bash
lsof -i :3000
```
- Kill any conflicting processes:
```bash
kill -9 <PID>
```

### 5. **Verify Environment Variables**
Ensure all required environment variables are set in `.env.local`:
```env
AZURE_CLIENT_ID=your_microsoft_365_client_id
AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_microsoft_365_client_secret
AZURE_TENANT_ID=your_microsoft_365_tenant_id
SNIPE_IT_URL=your_snipeit_instance_url
SNIPE_IT_API_TOKEN=your_snipeit_api_token
```

### 6. **Check Microsoft 365 API Access**
If user data isn't loading:
- Verify Microsoft Graph API permissions
- Check if the app registration is still active
- Ensure group membership access is correct

### 7. **Restart the Entire System (Last Resort)**
If all else fails:
```bash
sudo reboot
# After reboot, check if PM2 auto-starts the app
pm2 list
```

## System Architecture

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 with React and TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for responsive design
- **Backend**: API routes for user management and device inventory
- **External APIs**: Microsoft 365 Graph API, Snipe-IT API
