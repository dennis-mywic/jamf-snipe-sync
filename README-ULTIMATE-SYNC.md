## 🚀 Quick Start

### One Command to Rule Them All

```bash
cd /Users/dennis/dev/jamf-snipe-sync
./run-ultimate-sync.sh
```

This single command will:
1. Validate your environment
2. Fetch ALL devices from Jamf (computers + mobile devices)
3. Sync them to Snipe-IT with correct categorization
4. Map users automatically
5. Verify 100% completion
6. Generate comprehensive reports

### Estimated Time

- **~30-60 minutes** for 500 devices
- Time varies based on device count and network speed
- Progress is displayed in real-time

## 📋 Prerequisites

### 1. Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in the `jamf-snipe-sync` directory:

```env
# Jamf Pro Configuration
JAMF_URL=https://your-jamf-instance.jamfcloud.com
JAMF_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
JAMF_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret

# Snipe-IT Configuration
SNIPE_IT_URL=https://your-snipe-it-instance.com
SNIPE_IT_API_TOKEN=your_api_token
```

### 2. Python Requirements

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Required packages:
- `requests>=2.31.0`
- `python-dotenv>=1.0.0`
- `urllib3>=2.0.0`

### 3. Permissions

Make sure your API credentials have:
- **Jamf Pro**: Read access to computers, mobile devices, and prestage enrollments
- **Snipe-IT**: Full access to hardware, models, users, and categories

## 📁 Files Included

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `jamf-snipe-ultimate-100-percent-sync.py` | Main sync script with all features |
| `verify-100-percent-sync.py` | Verification script to check sync accuracy |
| `run-ultimate-sync.sh` | Easy-to-use runner script with confirmations |
| `README-ULTIMATE-SYNC.md` | This documentation |

## 🎯 Features

### 1. Complete Device Coverage

- Fetches **ALL** computers from Jamf Pro (with pagination)
- Fetches **ALL** mobile devices from Jamf Pro
- Includes devices from prestage enrollments
- No devices are skipped or missed

### 2. Intelligent Rate Limiting

```python
RATE_LIMIT_DELAY = 1.5    # Delay between API calls (seconds)
RETRY_DELAY = 5.0         # Initial delay for retries (seconds)
MAX_RETRIES = 5           # Maximum retry attempts
BATCH_SIZE = 100          # Process devices in batches
BATCH_DELAY = 10.0        # Delay between batches (seconds)
```

- Prevents API rate limiting (429 errors)
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- Batch processing to manage large device counts

### 3. Prestage-Based Categorization

Uses Jamf prestage enrollments for 100% accurate categorization:

| Prestage Pattern | Snipe-IT Category |
|------------------|-------------------|
| "Student", "Loaner" | Student Loaner Laptop |
| "SSC" | SSC Laptop |
| "Staff", "Employee" | Staff Mac Laptop |
| "Staff iPads" | Teacher iPad |
| "Kiosk iPad", "Check-In" | Check-In iPad |
| "Apple TV" | Apple TVs |

With smart fallbacks based on:
- Device model (iPad, Apple TV, etc.)
- Email domain (@student vs @staff)
- Device naming patterns

### 4. User Mapping

- Automatically looks up users in Snipe-IT by email
- Checks out devices to assigned users
- Handles name variations (McKenzie/MacKenzie, etc.)
- Caches user lookups to reduce API calls

### 5. Comprehensive Logging

Every sync operation logs:
- Device processing status
- Category assignments with reasoning
- User mapping results
- API call statistics
- Retry attempts
- Errors and warnings

### 6. Verification & Reporting

Final reports include:
- Total devices processed
- Created vs. updated counts
- Success/failure rates
- User mapping statistics
- API call metrics
- Missing device lists

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Issue: Rate Limiting (429 Errors)

**Solution**: The script has built-in rate limiting, but if you still see errors:

1. Increase delays in the script:
```python
RATE_LIMIT_DELAY = 2.0  # Increase from 1.5
BATCH_DELAY = 15.0      # Increase from 10.0
```

2. Reduce batch size:
```python
BATCH_SIZE = 50  # Decrease from 100
```

### Issue: Connection Timeouts

**Solution**: Check network connectivity and increase timeout:
```python
timeout=60  # Increase from 30
```

### Issue: Authentication Failures

**Solution**: Verify credentials in `.env`:
```bash
# Test Jamf connection
curl -X POST "${JAMF_URL}/api/oauth/token" \
  -d "client_id=${JAMF_CLIENT_ID}" \
  -d "grant_type=client_credentials" \
  -d "client_secret=${JAMF_CLIENT_SECRET}"

# Test Snipe-IT connection
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer ${SNIPE_IT_API_TOKEN}" \
  "${SNIPE_IT_URL}/api/v1/hardware?limit=1"
```

### Issue: Missing Devices After Sync

**Solution**: Run verification to identify missing devices:
```bash
python3 verify-100-percent-sync.py
```

Check the generated `missing_devices_*.txt` file for specific serials, then investigate why they failed.

### Issue: Incorrect Categorization

**Solution**: Check the prestage name in Jamf:
1. Look at the sync log for the device
2. Find the "PRESTAGE:" line showing the categorization logic
3. Update the prestage enrollment name in Jamf if needed
4. Re-run the sync

## 📈 Performance Tuning

### For Faster Sync (Use with Caution)

```python
RATE_LIMIT_DELAY = 0.5   # Reduce delay (risk of rate limiting)
BATCH_SIZE = 200         # Larger batches
MAX_WORKERS = 4          # Enable concurrent processing (requires code modification)
```

### For Maximum Reliability

```python
RATE_LIMIT_DELAY = 2.0   # More conservative delay
BATCH_SIZE = 50          # Smaller batches
MAX_RETRIES = 10         # More retry attempts
```

## 🔐 Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit `.env` file** to version control
   ```bash
   echo ".env" >> .gitignore
   ```

2. **Use API credentials with minimal required permissions**

3. **Rotate API tokens regularly**

4. **Store credentials securely** (use environment variables or secrets manager)

5. **Review logs** but ensure they don't contain sensitive data

## 📅 Maintenance

### Daily Sync Schedule

For production use, schedule daily sync:

```bash
# Add to cron
0 2 * * * cd /Users/dennis/dev/jamf-snipe-sync && ./run-ultimate-sync.sh >> /var/log/jamf-ultimate-sync.log 2>&1
```

### Weekly Verification

Schedule weekly verification:

```bash
# Add to cron
0 3 * * 1 cd /Users/dennis/dev/jamf-snipe-sync && python3 verify-100-percent-sync.py >> /var/log/jamf-verification.log 2>&1
```

### Log Rotation

Clean up old logs periodically:

```bash
# Keep only last 30 days of logs
find /Users/dennis/dev/jamf-snipe-sync -name "*.log" -mtime +30 -delete
```

## 🎓 How It Works

### 1. Authentication
- Obtains OAuth token from Jamf Pro
- Validates Snipe-IT API token

### 2. Device Discovery
- Fetches ALL computers from Jamf (paginated)
- Fetches ALL mobile devices from Jamf (paginated)
- Retrieves detailed info for each device

### 3. Data Enrichment
- Gets prestage enrollment data
- Extracts user information (email, username)
- Retrieves hardware details (model, serial)

### 4. Category Determination
- Analyzes prestage enrollment name (primary)
- Checks device model type (fallback)
- Examines email patterns (fallback)
- Reviews device naming (fallback)

### 5. Model Management
- Searches for category-specific model
- Creates new model if doesn't exist
- Caches models to reduce API calls

### 6. Asset Sync
- Checks if asset exists in Snipe-IT
- Creates new or updates existing
- Sets correct category and status

### 7. User Assignment
- Looks up user by email in Snipe-IT
- Checks out device to user if found
- Caches user lookups

### 8. Verification
- Compares Jamf and Snipe-IT inventories
- Identifies missing or extra devices
- Calculates accuracy percentages

## 🤝 Support
